## 🚩 Updates

- ☑ Our **CARE-Edit** is accepted by **CVPR 2026**. The paper and codes will be released soon.

## 💡 Motivation

Existing unified diffusion editors suffer from task interference and cannot dynamically handle conflicting conditions, leading to color bleeding, identity drift, and unpredictable behavior. We propose **CARE-Edit** - a unified editor which routes diffusion tokens to **four specialized experts** via a lightweight **condition-aware router**.

## 🔧 Framework

</p>

**CARE-Edit** introduces condition-aware specialized experts within the frozen DiT backbone. Given multimodal conditions, inputs are tokenized and projected to **heterogeneous expert branches**. The router assigns confidence scores and selects the Top-K experts to process each token. Expert outputs are normalized, modulated, and fused through the **Latent Mixture** module, yielding denoised representations refined by **Mask Repaint** module.
